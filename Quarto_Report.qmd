# Introduction

According to UNICEF, nearly **400 million children under the age of 5** regularly experience violent discipline, including physical punishment and psychological aggression.

> Physical violence against children, though universally condemned, remains prevalent across various parts of the world.\
> Despite progress in human rights, **physical punishment continues to be accepted and practiced** in many regions due to cultural norms, historical contexts, and economic challenges.

This report aims to raise public awareness about this ongoing issue by analyzing global legislation, regional differences, and the evolution of protection laws over time.

The **UNICEF Indicator 2 and UNICEF metadata** are used as primary sources. This analysis can be complemented with a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/kristina.konstantynova/viz/TableauProject_17426360290860/Tableaudebord12#1) to provide interactive visual insights.

**Across the world, physical punishment remains deeply ingrained in many cultures.**\
While some regions have made progress in reducing its acceptance, others continue to grapple with widespread support for corporal punishment.\
**This map shows just how diverse the situation is:**

-   Oceania and parts of Africa still show high levels of support,

-   while Europe has made remarkable progress, with much lower acceptance.

# üìä Support by Continent

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Prepare the continent data
continent_chart <- df %>%
  filter(sex == "Total", !is.na(obs_value), !is.na(continents)) %>%
  group_by(continents) %>%
  summarise(support_pct = round(mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE)), .groups = "drop") %>%
  arrange(desc(support_pct))

# Create the static ggplot bar chart
ggplot(continent_chart, aes(x = reorder(continents, support_pct), y = support_pct, fill = support_pct)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  coord_flip() +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fee5d9", high = "#a50f15") +
  labs(
    title = "Where People Most Support Physical Punishment (by Continent)",
    x = "",
    y = "Support (%)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "#8B0000", size = 16, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text = element_text(size = 11),
    axis.title.y = element_blank(),
    legend.position = "none"
  ) +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(support_pct, "%")), hjust = -0.2, size = 4)
```

**Looking at the continents, we see stark differences in attitudes toward physical punishment.**

-   **Oceania**, for instance, shows consistently high levels of support for physical punishment, despite modern living conditions.

-   **Africa** also continues to show higher levels of acceptance, driven in part by cultural traditions and economic factors.

-    In contrast, **Europe** stands out with a significant decline in support ‚Äî a shift largely due to legal reforms and a cultural movement toward non-violent child-rearing.

# üéØ **Focus on Top 10 Supporting Countries** 

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)

# Load your data
df <- read_delim("data/V4 unicef_indicator_2.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Prepare Top 10 countries

  slice_max(order_by = support_pct, n = 10)

# Create bubble chart

  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "white", alpha = 0.9) +
  scale_size(range = c(15, 50)) +  # Bigger bubbles
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#fee5d9", high = "#a50f15") +
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(support_pct), "%")), color = "white", size = 5, vjust = 0.5, fontface = "bold") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Countries Supporting Physical Punishment",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL,
    size = "% Support",
    fill = "% Support"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    plot.title = element_text(color = "#8B0000", size = 18, face = "bold", hjust = 0.5),
    axis.text.x = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),
    legend.position = "none"
  )

```

Countries like **Sweden** and **Germany** have fully rejected physical punishment due to strong legal frameworks and progressive cultural shifts. However, nations in Oceania and Africa, such as **Samoa** and **Nigeria**, still show high levels of support, reflecting the persistence of historical practices and deep-rooted cultural beliefs.

# üí∞ Economic Context: GDP vs Support

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(plotly)

# Load datasets
df <- read_delim("data/V4 unicef_indicator_2.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE)
metadata <- read_csv("data/unicef_metadata.csv")

# Prepare support data
support_avg <- df %>%
  filter(sex == "Total", 
         str_detect(indicator, regex("physical punishment", ignore_case = TRUE)), 
         !is.na(obs_value)) %>%
  group_by(country, continents) %>%
  summarise(support_pct = mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Prepare GDP data
gdp_df <- metadata %>%
  select(country, `GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)`) %>%
  rename(gdp_per_capita = `GDP per capita (constant 2015 US$)`)

# Merge
scatter_df <- left_join(support_avg, gdp_df, by = "country") %>%
  filter(!is.na(gdp_per_capita))

# Create interactive scatterplot
plot_ly(
  data = scatter_df,
  x = ~gdp_per_capita,
  y = ~support_pct,
  color = ~continents,   # Color by continent
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'markers',
  marker = list(size = 10, opacity = 0.8, line = list(width = 0.5, color = 'grey')),
  text = ~paste("<b>", country, "</b><br>Continent:", continents, "<br>GDP: $", round(gdp_per_capita), "<br>Support:", round(support_pct), "%"),
  hoverinfo = 'text'
) %>% layout(
  title = list(text = '<b style="color:#8B0000;">GDP per Capita vs Support for Physical Punishment</b>'),
  xaxis = list(title = "GDP per Capita (USD)"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Physical Punishment Support (%)"),
  legend = list(title = list(text = '<b>Continent</b>'))
)
```

There is a clear connection between economic conditions and support for physical punishment.\
In wealthier countries, where economic stability and education are more accessible, support for physical punishment tends to be lower.\
In contrast, poorer regions like **Africa** still see high levels of corporal punishment, driven by poverty, lack of education, and social stress.

However, some wealthy countries, such as those in **Oceania**, still show significant support for physical punishment ‚Äî suggesting that cultural norms play a strong role alongside economic factors.\
This underscores the **complex relationship between economic growth, cultural traditions, and disciplinary practices**.

# üìà Trend Over Time

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)

# Load dataset
df <- read_delim("data/V4 unicef_indicator_2.csv", delim = ";", show_col_types = FALSE)

# Prepare time series data
ts_df <- df %>%
  filter(
    sex == "Total",
    str_detect(indicator, regex("physical punishment", ignore_case = TRUE)),
    !is.na(obs_value),
    !is.na(continents)
  ) %>%
  group_by(time_period, continents) %>%
  summarise(support_pct = mean(obs_value, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = "drop")

# Create interactive line chart
plot_ly(
  data = ts_df,
  x = ~time_period,
  y = ~support_pct,
  color = ~continents,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'lines+markers',
  text = ~paste("<b>", continents, "</b><br>Year:", time_period, "<br>Support:", round(support_pct), "%"),
  hoverinfo = 'text',
  line = list(width = 2)
) %>% layout(
  title = list(text = '<b style="color:#8B0000;">Trends in Physical Punishment Support by Continent</b>'),
  xaxis = list(title = "Year"),
  yaxis = list(title = "Support (%)"),
  legend = list(title = list(text = '<b>Continent</b>'))
)
```

Looking at trends over time, we can see that attitudes have changed in many regions.\
While some countries ‚Äî particularly in **Europe** ‚Äî have consistently reduced support, others like those in **Oceania** and **Africa** remain high.

Though global trends have evolved over time, the year **2020** stands out, particularly in Oceania.\
The sharp rise in support for physical punishment ‚Äî jumping from **38% to 86%** ‚Äî points to a deeper societal change, likely influenced by the **COVID-19 pandemic** and the stresses that came with it.

This shift illustrates how **external pressures** can force societies to revisit long-standing practices and attitudes toward discipline.

The path forward requires:

-   Legal reforms
-   Cultural change
-   Increased awareness
